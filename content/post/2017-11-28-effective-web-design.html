<p>A couple of idea gathered from various readings about Web design, in brief.</p>
<div id="key-aspects" class="section level2">
<h2>Key aspects</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Usability</strong> is more important than <strong>visual design</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong> and <strong>credibility</strong> are essential.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity</strong>: KIS principle.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: yes, con-si-sten-cy!!!</li>
<li><strong>80/20 rule (Pareto principle)</strong>: 80% of result comes from 20% of the users. Identify these 20% and optimise the site for them.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="conventions" class="section level2">
<h2>Conventions</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stick on conventions</strong>: reduce the learning curve by building on existing user’s knowledge.</li>
<li><em><strong>Innovate only when you know you have a better idea.</strong></em></li>
<li><strong>Baby-Duck-syndrome</strong>: users tend to stick with the first design they learn.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="general-layout" class="section level2">
<h2>General layout</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visible language</strong>: organise - economise (simplicity + clarity + distinctiveness + emphasis).</li>
<li><strong>Law of proximity</strong>: group elements spatially for a better perception of their relationship.</li>
<li><strong>Split large pages</strong>: web pages are not books. Split large content into several pages and make navigation between them obvious, simple and handy.</li>
<li><strong>Feature exposure</strong>: 1-2-3-done step, large buttons with visual effects = modern web design, … but modern web designs are also criticised for that!</li>
<li><strong>Adjust the layout for different sizes</strong> (think smartphone -&gt; tablet -&gt; PC)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="graphical-elements" class="section level2">
<h2>Graphical elements</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fonts</strong>: limit their number. Max three fonts in max three point sizes.</li>
<li><strong>Page width</strong>: max 18 words/50-80 characters per lines. Constrain max page width to match it.</li>
<li><strong>White space</strong>: reduce cognitive load, help users to scan the page effectively with large white spaces.</li>
<li><strong>Images</strong>: pictures are eye-catching, use them wisely to convey the message and/or focus attention.</li>
<li><strong>Icons</strong> should be used where they can easily be recognised (e.g., RSS-feed, Home, Search button, …). <a href="http://fontawesome.io">Fonts Awesome</a> or equivalent are very useful here.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="effective-communication" class="section level2">
<h2>Effective communication</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid information</strong>: the first page must be quickly informative about the site content and about recent changes. Here is an <a href="http://themes.laborator.co/#theme=kalium">example</a> of a site pushing this concept very (too?) far.</li>
<li><strong>Inverted pyramid</strong>: place summary and major points or conclusions at the top of an article.</li>
<li><strong>Go directly to the point</strong>, e.g., <em>“<strong>Free</strong> service, sign up here”</em>. Even better if “Free” stands out. Use short and concise phrases.</li>
<li><strong>Effective writing</strong>: do not write web pages like textbooks. Avoid promotional writing, avoid long paragraphs without images, or words in bold (arghh! But I <strong>like</strong> this), italic or with links.</li>
<li><strong>Videos</strong>. Use (and abuse) of very short video presentations as complimentary material, but only to convey the message (no funny cats videos, just to amuse -and distract- your readers!). Think also at <a href="https://giphy.com">animated gifs</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="navigation" class="section level2">
<h2>Navigation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>7±2 principle</strong>. Human’s short-term memory can retain 5-9 things at one time. Limit number of options in navigation menus to 7 (but controverses exist, see breadth vs depth hereunder). In any case, reduce short-term memory load as much as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Breadth vs depth</strong>. If you display less at a time, you need to go deeper in the hierarchy to cover the same set of options. There is a tradeoff to find between breadth and depth.</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical structures</strong> reduce complexity (Simon’s law), e.g., in menus.</li>
<li><strong>3-click-rule</strong>: many users would stop using the site if they don’t find what they are looking for in 3 clicks max. But if they are able to know exactly where they are, they accept more (the 3-click-rule only applies to exploration in “unknown zones”).</li>
<li><strong>Enable shortcuts</strong> for frequent users.</li>
<li><strong>Welcome trial-and-error approach</strong>: give informative feedback + use simple error handling + ease reversal of actions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="usability" class="section level2">
<h2>Usability</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scan-click-behaviour</strong>: users don’t read but scan pages and click in the first link that looks more or less to what they are looking for. Keep this in mind 110% of the time when designing/writing a web page.</li>
<li><strong>Banner-blindness</strong>: users are used to advertisements and thus, tend to ignore large and colourful banners that look like advertisements.</li>
<li><strong>Focus attention</strong>: use eye-catching elements (pictures, bold text, …) wisely to gently direct the reader. Avoid flashing elements or animations that catch too much attention and are distracting, on the contrary.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate intuition</strong>. Any product that needs a manual to work is broken, this is certainly the case for web sites: web page should be obvious and self-explanatory.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="perception" class="section level2">
<h2>Perception</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Features exposition</strong>: let the user see clearly what functions are available.</li>
<li><strong>Give control</strong>: users want to have control all the time.</li>
<li><strong>Impatience</strong>: web users are impatient and want instant return.</li>
<li><strong>2-second-rule</strong>. Regarding reactivity, avoid anything that would take more than two seconds to load.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="test-your-design" class="section level2">
<h2>Test your design</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test early, test often</strong> TETO-principle</li>
<li><strong>Test is an iterative process</strong>: change - test - change - test, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Test with naive/new users</strong> (and don’t trust your own feeling: you, as the designer, are not a naive/new user)</li>
<li><strong>Test on all browser configurations</strong> that will be used at least 80% of the time (think about the Pareto principle), and make sure to provide readable -but not necessarily optimised- fallback solutions for the rest, e.g., very old browsers, or Javascript disabled.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="miscellaneous" class="section level2">
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Copyright</strong>: think about license for your site, your data, your images. Don’t enfringe others rights. Give due credits, in particular for pictures you use.</li>
<li><strong>Printing style</strong> for HTML pages: look how your page look like when printed, if it is pertinent, and design special CSS code for printed material.</li>
<li><strong>Inspiration</strong>: scan web sites with a critical eye. Get inspired by good ideas.</li>
<li><strong>Images and binary resource</strong> should be kept outside version control repositories as much as possible, but it complexifies the whole system.</li>
<li><strong>URL shortener</strong>: good for short-term use, but to be prohibited for web sites, unless you have full control on them, including the URL they point to, in order to adapt them (e.g., <a href="http://www.rebrandly.com">Rebrandly</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Static pages</strong>: you can go very far with static pages generated with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, and you get also full reproducible production including data analysis using <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/">Bookdown</a> or <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">Blogdown</a>.</li>
</ul>
